# /etc/profile: system-wide .profile file for the Bourne shell (sh(1))
# and Bourne compatible shells (bash(1), ksh(1), ash(1), ...).
# From man bash:
# "... When bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive
# shell with the --login option, it first  reads  and  executes  commands
# from  the  file  /etc/profile,  if that file exists.  After reading that
# file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile, in that
# order, and reads and executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable.  
# The --noprofile option  may  be  used when  the  shell  is started to inhibit
# this behavior. "
